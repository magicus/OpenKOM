Prerequirements:

* A working MySQL installation, version 4.0 or higher.

* A working Java SDK installation, version 1.3 or higher.

Database initialization:

Apply the script sql/initmysql.sql to your database. It creates a database 
named "kom", and creates a user "kom" with password "kom" with access to this.

SSH2:

You need to create a server host key-file with an empty passphrase and place
it in the top openkom directory with the name "server_host_key". Check for example
http://www.openssh.com for a keygen.

Configuration:

conf/modules.xml contains all server configuration. Check the JDBC URL, port numbers,
and the name of the server host key-file.

conf/log4j.properties contains all logging configuration, check the log4j documentation
at http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/documentation.html. The default settings will
log everything to stdout. If you want to log to a file, it is strongly recommended
to do that through log4j by exchanging the consoleappender for a fileappender.

Running OpenKOM:

Check run.sh or run.bat for a simple example which assumes that "java" on your command
line will start a working JVM and that all environment variables it needs are ok.

In general, the start class is nu.rydin.kom.boot.Bootstrap, and all the included 
jar-files plus the conf-directory must be in the classpath.

When OpenKOM starts for the first time it will create the user sysop/sysop. Use this
account to create other users, and remember to change the password of the sysop account.
